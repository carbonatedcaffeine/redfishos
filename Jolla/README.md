## About Jolla folder

This folder contains some documentation and apps icons template and library. Some of this material is under Creative Commons some other is copyrighted by Jolla.

At the time I did the backup, there was not into the copyright notice "*all right reserved*" but by default the copyright is always "*all right reserved*" therefore such documentation in PDF should be considered as a fair-use backup and the original website should be consulted as long as it would be available on-line.
