### Pantones

### Animation

This is the animation which is displayed after the Sony logo until the system is up:

<p><div align="center"><img src="rfos-anim-circles-16c-2x.gif" width="256px" height="256px"></div></p>

This animation seems very similar to the one presented by the SailFish OS but it is not a derived work. In fact, the original animation is based on 8 PNG images in grayscale (256x256 pixels), each of which is about 29 KB (58 blocks). When included in the `cpio.gz` archive, they cannot be compressed anymore, and keep their size. Instead of the RFOS animation, there are 8 PNG images in RGB 512x512 pixels, and in theory, that would have a size of 3 x 2 x 2 = 12 times bigger. Instead, they are about 5.3 KB (11 blocks).

* 58 blocks x 8 images = 464 blocks
* 58 blocks x 3 x 4 x 8 images = 5568 blocks

The ratio between the size expected and the real one is about 2‚Å∂ = 64 which is a **HUGE** gap. Which is the trick? Jolla used a vector template for the animation, like SVG in the original, but trying to bring such a graphic to 16 indexed colours in total creates a lot of artefacts. The artefacts make the animation appear hugly. The solution, is to work pixel by pixel and make the 16 indexed colours look like they were in RGB. Naturally, there is automation to do this work, but the final stage is checking pixel by pixel. This is the main difference between an artwork and an image generated by a vectorial template.

### The telnet banner

This is the use of the RFOS logo in combination with the telnet IPv4 informative banner:

<img src="../recovery/ramdisk/res/images/ip-10.42.66.66.png" width="256px" height="256px">

Initially to print the banner and creating its related PNG image was a task assigned to a specific [script](r../ecovery/print-banner.sh) due to the limitations of the `yamui` display manager. Now it is rendered in real-time thanks to the effort put into the development of [yamui fork](https://github.com/robang74/yamui) secifically tailored for this project. The `yamui` embedded font is more conventional but the extended functionalities developed can provide a more advanced and flexible display management while the embedded font can replaced by an external font in the future.

### The boot timing

Here in 1:1 video on youtube the 20s reboot sequence:

In the video the red dots seem orange but they are red.
