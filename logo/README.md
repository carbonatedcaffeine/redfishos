The logo and the motto have been proposed to specifically fit the taste and expectations of the [marketing targets](../marketing.md#marketing-targets): Linux embedded engineers in their middle-life age who are looking for an old-good-days simple and powerful tool to cope with mobile devices initially tailored for Android.

The two parts of these artworks (top and bottom) can be used separately as the RedFish OS logo and are therefore protected separately.

### Pantones

The logo's main colours are total black (`#000000`), pure white (`#ffffff`) and full red (`#ff0000`).

### Animation

This is the animation that is displayed after the Sony logo until the system is up:

<p><div align="center"><img src="rfos-anim-circles-16c-2x.gif" width="256px" height="256px"></div></p>

This animation seems very similar to the one presented by the SailFish OS, but it is not a derived work. In fact, the original animation is based on 8 PNG images in grayscale (256x256 pixels), each of which is about 29 KB (58 blocks). When included in the `cpio.gz` archive, they cannot be compressed anymore and keep their size. Instead of the RFOS animation, there are 8 PNG images in RGB 512x512 pixels, and in theory, that would have a size of 3 x 2 x 2 = 12 times bigger. Instead, they are about 5.3 KB (11 blocks).

* 58 blocks x 8 images = 464 blocks
* 58 blocks x 3 x 4 x 8 images = 5568 blocks

The ratio between the size expected and the real one is about 2‚Å∂ = 64, which is a **HUGE** gap. Which is the trick? Jolla used a vector template for the animation, like SVG in the original, but trying to bring such a graphic to 16 indexed colours in total creates a lot of artefacts. The artefacts make the animation appear hugly.

The solution is to work pixel by pixel and make the 16 indexed colours look like they were in RGB. Naturally, there is automation to do this work, but the final stage is checking pixel by pixel. This is the main difference between an artwork and an image generated by a vectorial template.

### The telnet banner

This is the use of the RFOS logo in combination with the `telnet` IPv4 informative banner:

<p><div align="center"><img src="../recovery/ramdisk/res/images/ip-10.42.66.66.png" width="256px" height="256px"></div></p>

Initially, printing the banner and creating its related PNG image was a task assigned to a specific [script](r../ecovery/print-banner.sh) due to the limitations of the `yamui` display manager. Now it is rendered in real-time thanks to the effort put into the development of the [yamui fork](https://github.com/robang74/yamui) specifically tailored for this project.

The `yamui` embedded font is more conventional, but the extended functionalities developed can provide a more advanced and flexible display management, while the embedded font can be replaced by an external font in the future. Refer to the [Punkt MP02 virtual clone](#punkt-mp02-virtual-clone) section for an example of the `yamui` advanced usage.
