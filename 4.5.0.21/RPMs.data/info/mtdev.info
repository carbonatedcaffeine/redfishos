Summary     : A library to transform all kernel MT events to protocol B (slotted)
Description :
mtdev - The mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of
kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev
may be from any MT device, specifically type A without contact tracking,
type A with contact tracking, or type B with contact tracking. See the
kernel documentation for further details. The bulk of the mtdev code has
been out there since 2008, as part of the Multitouch X Driver. With this
package, finger tracking and seamless MT protocol handling is available
under a free license.
