Summary     : Desktop-neutral metadata database and search tool
Description :
Tracker is a powerful desktop-neutral first class object database,
tag/metadata database and search tool.

It consists of a common object database that allows entities to have an
almost infinite number of properties, metadata (both embedded/harvested as
well as user definable), a comprehensive database of keywords/tags and
links to other entities.

It provides additional features for file based objects including context
linking and audit trails for a file object.

Metadata indexers are provided by the tracker-miners package.
