Summary     : An audio codec for use in low-delay speech and audio communication
Description :
Opus is a codec for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet.
Opus can handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including
Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game  chat, and even remote live music
performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high
quality stereo music.
Opus, when coupled with an appropriate container format, is also suitable
for non-realtime  stored-file applications such as music distribution, game
soundtracks, portable music players, jukeboxes, and other applications that
have historically used high latency formats such as MP3, AAC, or Vorbis.
