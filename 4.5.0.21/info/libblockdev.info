Summary     : A library for low-level manipulation with block devices
Description :
The libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be
used for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM,
BTRFS, LUKS or MD RAID. The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as
a thin wrapper around its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can
be used as standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is
that it is stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has
no information about VGs when creating an LV).
