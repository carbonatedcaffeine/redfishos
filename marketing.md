## Marketing

First of all, it is important to notice that this project does not aim to reach the end-user market directly. The RFOS marketing targets are the vendors, the distributors, the engineers, and the modders, including those who are doing such activities as hobbies.

The end-users might have several advantages in having RedFish OS pre-installed as a recovery image or as a supervising system, but they are not the targets of the RFOS marketing because most of the on-the-shelf smartphones do not allow to overwrite the boot or the recovery image, and those that allow it do so not by a bare-simple procedure. Otherwise, end-users would probably brick their smartphones or install a malicious rootkit instead of something really useful. Plus, it would void the vendor's warranty, obviously.

### Product presentation

RedFish OS has the primary goal of complementing Android rather than
replacing it. It can serve for various purposes, such as a flashing tool,
firmware supervisor, system configuration manager, IoT fleet manager,
B2C support gateway, benign rootkit for security and privacy, and a
customizable device for penetration testing, which is the reason for
having chosen the name RedFish OS in the first place.

Therefore, RedFish OS is a proof-of-concept demonstrating that Android
hardware support, including a custom kernel and firmware blobs, can be
utilised to run a traditional GNU/Linux system. This opens up a lot of
modding possibilities for every device based on a System-on-Chip (SoC)
with Android support.

Before RedFish OS, companies dealing with embedded systems like
automotive, smart TV, and set-top box manufacturers had to customise
their products for each SoC model and version. They relied on the hope
that hardware producers would provide sufficient support, and they
were involved in technical activities that were costly and challenging.
