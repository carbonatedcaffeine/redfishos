Few components in SailFish OS are proprietary and because the package downloaded from their shop contains such proprietary software and vendor firmware. Some other proprietary software and vendor firmare cames from Sony Open Device AOSP.

Instead, the boot images are compositions of binaries from on open source and software libre projects, only. Therefore the boot images can be freely redistribute as far as those redistribuite them fulfil the FOSS licenses obbligations related to that binaries.

## License

Almost all the files are under MIT license or GPLv2 and the others are in the public domain. Instead, the composition of these files is protected by the GPLv3 license under the effects of the Copyright Act, title 17. U.S.C. ยง 101.

> Under the Copyright Act, a compilation [EdN: "composition" is used here as synonym because compilation might confuse the reader about code compiling] is defined as a "collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data [EdN: source code, as well] that are selected in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship."

This means that everyone can use a single MIT licensed file or a part of it under the MIT license terms. Instead, using two of them or two parts of them implies that you are using a subset of this collection. Thus a derived work of this collection which is licensed under the GPLv3 also.

The GPLv3 license applies to the composition unless you are the original copyright owner or the author of a specific unmodified file. This means that every one that can legally claim rights about the original files maintains its rights, obviously. So, it should not need to complain with the GPLv3 license applied to the composition. Unless, the composition is adopted for the part which had not the rights, before.

An exception is this specific file which is "all rights reserved, but fair use allowed", here:

* none for now but just in case, it will be listed here
