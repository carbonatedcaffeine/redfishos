## About Jolla folder

This folder contains some documentation, an app icon template, and a library. Some of this material is under Creative Commons, while others are copyrighted by Jolla.

At the time I did the backup, there was not a copyright notice saying "*all rights reserved*", but by default the copyright is always "*all rights reserved*". Therefore, such documentation in PDF should be considered a fair-use backup, and the original website should be consulted as long as it is available online.
