This is a list of patches developed to evaluate the potential of `Patch Manager`Â and how it works.

## System patches

In order to apply patches to the system a special header has been designed

* [patch_system_header.prod.txt](patch_system_header.prod.txt)

* [patch_system_header.test.txt](patch_system_header.test.txt)

The second one is for testing only, while the first is a general example to use.
