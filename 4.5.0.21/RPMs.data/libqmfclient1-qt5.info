Summary     : Qt Messaging Framework (QMF) client library
Description :
The Qt Messaging Framework, QMF, consists of a C++ library and daemon server
process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
that interacts with email and mail servers.

The Client library provides classes giving access to all messages stored on
the device, via a uniform interface. It simplifies the task of creating
messaging client applications, and permits other Messaging Framework
applications to interact with messaging data where appropriate. New types of
messages can be supported by the library without modification to existing
client applications.

This package contains a library for developing applications that work with
messages.
