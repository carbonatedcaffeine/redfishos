Summary     : Sailfish Application Library
Description :
This library should be used by Sailfish applications to create a QML view.
libsailfishapp will take care of using the booster if possible, and will
also make sure that applications built with the Sailfish SDK are future-
proof, by putting all special cases inside libsailfishapp, where it can be
updated by the vendor.
