Summary     : Prolog Interpreter
Description :
ISO/Edinburgh-style Prolog compiler.  Compliant with Part 1 of the ISO standard
for Prolog.  Covers all traditional Edinburgh Prolog features and shares many
features with Quintus and SICStus Prolog, including a compatible module system.
Very fast compiler, garbage collection (also on atoms), fast and powerful C/C++
interface, autoloading, GNU-readline interface.

SWI-Prolog has been designed and implemented such that it can easily be
modified for experiments with logic programming and the relation
between logic programming and other programming paradigms (such as the
object oriented XPCE environment).  SWI-Prolog has a rich set of
built-in predicates and reasonable performance, which makes it possible
to develop substantial applications in it.  The current version offers
a module system, garbage collection and an interface to the C language.
