### About SailFish OS

The SailFish OS is not open-source nor software libre and cannot be redistributed but can be downloaded for free (gratis) from the Jolla Shop:  

* [Jolla SailFish OS download shop](https://shop.jolla.com/)
* [Jolla SailFish OS website](https://sailfishos.org/)
* [Jolla offial documentation](https://docs.sailfishos.org/)

The licensed version adds the supports for Android by Alien Dalvik proprietary middle-ware framework plus some others features. The zero-budget version is supported by its related community:

* [Community Forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/)
* [Community apps repository](https://sailfish.openrepos.net/)
* [Patch Manager Web Catalog](http://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/)

Few components in SailFish OS are proprietary and because the package downloaded from their shop contains such proprietary software, it cannot considered open-source nor software libre. Some other proprietary software cames from Sony Open Device AOSP, instead.

Instead, the boot images are compositions of binaries from on open source and software libre projects, only. Therefore the boot images can be freely redistribute as far as those redistribuite them fulfil the FOSS licenses obbligations related to that binaries. 

The alternative is to link this page which the aim is to collect all those FOSS contributes. However, you have to check by yourself if these list of resources is complete and updated respect the boot image that you wish to distribute.
