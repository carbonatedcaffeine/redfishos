> The scripts in `recovery` folder are still in beta testing. Do not use them unless you are sure about what you are doing. Here below are a couple of exceptions to this general rule: the scripts for generating the `recovery`, `sysdebug` and `extralibs` archives, which are quite well tested. However, the three archives that they produce, installed in the SFOS root filesystem, can potentially brick your system. Hence, you have been warned.

## About recovery package

To create this package, `aarch64` binaries and libraries from `Centos 8` and `Fedora 31` RPM repositories have been used.

This below is the list of the main binaries, while some others, which are their helpers, have been not reported:

* `dd_rescue`, `dd_rhelp`, `rsyc`, `parted`, `patch`, `pigz`, `cgdisk`, `gdisk`, `sgdisk`, `fixparts` 

Just the essential utilities packaged into a gzip tarball to explode directly on the root filesystem:

```
tar -k xvzf $PWD/recovery-utils.tar.gz -C /
```

The `-k` avoids overwriting the original files, but it is supposed that they were not in place if you need this tarball.

Or it can be exploded into the volatile `/tmp` exporting these variables:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/tmp/usr/bin LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

to set properly the shell environment for using the imported binaries in `/tmp`.

The script that downloads and creates this tarball is here:

* [do_recovery-utils_tgz.sh](do_recovery-utils_tgz.sh)

The created package is less than 2.8 MB. What is missing is `strings` because its dependency will have brought this package to a size of 1.5Mb while a 2x faster 16Kb version of `strings` can be compiled from [this source](strings.c) presented in the busybox developers m-list in [this thread](https://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2023-July/090396.html).

## About sysdebug package

To create this package, `aarch64` binaries and libraries from `Centos 8` and `Fedora 31` RPM repositories have been used.

This below is the list of the main binaries, while some others, which are their helpers, have been not reported:

* `arp-scan`, `tcpdump`, `tcpslice`, `ntpdate`, `tcptraceroute`, `traceroute`, `ncat`, `dig`, `host`, `nslookup`, `strace`, `stress-ng`.

The script that downloads and creates the `sysdebug` tarball is here:

* [do_sysdebug-utils_tgz.sh](do_sysdebug-utils_tgz.sh)

The created tarball size is about 7.2 MB. Therefore, it is not included in this repository.

Moreover, due to its nature, it is not immediate - at the moment - to deploy somewhere else than the root filesystem:

```
tar -k xvzf $PWD/sysdebug-utils.tar.gz -C /
```

The `-k` avoids overwriting the original files, but it is supposed that they were not in place if you need this tarball.

* [do_sysdebug-utils-extralibs_tgz.sh](do_sysdebug-utils-extralibs_tgz.sh)

The `sysdebug` package can be installed also in the [recovery image](ramdisk#readme) via SSH. In such a case, it requires extra libraries and the script above provide to create the related package. Its compressed size is a mear 6.1 MB.

<sup>________</sup>

> :warning: **WARNING**
>
> In the `sysdebug` tarball is included `stress-ng` a command-line tool that can put your smartphone's CPUs under full work-load. This tools is not a 100% harmless toy because, in the unlucky scenario in which the CPUs' thermal throttle is broken, down, or whatever but not correctly functioning, you seriously risk literally cooking your smartphone. Therefore, the first time you play with it to stress your CPUs herd, pay close attention to their temperature, and `System Monitor` may not help but trick you because monitoring my Xperia 10 II, it reports 36Â°C all the time.

### Scripts dependencies

Both scripts requires some extra dependencies, if they are executed with `--ssh-test` as command line parameter:

* [do_ssh_ldd_test_utils.env](do_ssh_ldd_test_utils.env) - it contains the code to make the `ldd` libraries test via SSH 

* [pcos / sfos-ssh-connect.env](../scripts/pcos/sfos-ssh-connect.env) - it is the bash environment required by the script above for SSH automatic connection.

* [sfos-ssh-connect-env patch](https://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/project/sfos-ssh-connect-env) - it is the script that enable the quick & safe password-less root-login via SSH, a system setup-up required by the environment above. 

The `--ssh-test` enables shell script code which copy and test via SSH the tarball content about libraries dependency with `ldd`.

### Full features busybox

Most - but not all - the command-line binaries included into these tarballs can be replaced by those available into the full features busybox statically linked available at the link here below:

* [sailfish-os-busybox 1.36.1-git2-raf3 all-arch .zip archive](https://github.com/robang74/sailfish-os-busybox/actions/runs/5649829805)

Before installing any of the RPM package contained in that .zip archive read [this page](https://github.com/robang74/sailfish-os-busybox#readme).
