### About SailFish OS

> __Warning__: the SailFish OS is **not** *open source* **nor** *software libre* but largerly based on several FOSS projects.

* [SailFish OS on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS)

Therefore it cannot be *almost* redistributed AS-IS even if can be downloaded for free (gratis) from the Jolla Shop:  

* [Jolla SailFish OS download shop](https://shop.jolla.com/)
* [Jolla how to flash SFOS with Linux](https://jolla.com/how-to-install-sailfish-x-on-xperia-10-ii-on-linux/)
* [Jolla SailFish OS website](https://sailfishos.org/)
* [Jolla offial documentation](https://docs.sailfishos.org/)

The paid licensed version adds the support for Android integrating the proprietary [Alien Dalvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalvik_Turbo_virtual_machine) middle-ware framework plus some others features. The zero-budget version is supported by its related community:

* [Community Forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/)
* [Community apps repository](https://sailfish.openrepos.net/)
* [Patch Manager Web Catalog](http://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/)

Few components in SailFish OS are proprietary and the package downloaded from their shop contains such proprietary software and vendor firmware. The framework to build the images is an open source project:

* [MER project Wiki page](https://wiki.merproject.org/wiki/Main_Page)

Some other proprietary software and vendor firmare cames from Sony Open Device AOSP. Instead, the boot images are compositions of binaries from on open source and software libre projects, only. Therefore the boot images can be freely redistribute as far as those redistribuite them fulfil the FOSS licenses obbligations related to that binaries. 

> __Note__  The alternative to fullfil yourself that obbligations is to link this page which the aim is to collect all those FOSS contributes. However, you have to check by yourself if these list of resources is complete and updated respect the boot image that you wish to distribute.

## License

Almost all the files are under MIT license or GPLv2 or v3 and the others are in the public domain. Instead, the composition of these files is protected by the GPLv3 license under the effects of the Copyright Act, title 17. U.S.C. ยง 101.

> Under the Copyright Act, a compilation [EdN: "composition" is used here as synonym because compilation might confuse the reader about code compiling] is defined as a "collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data [EdN: source code, as well] that are selected in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship."

This means that everyone can use a single MIT licensed file or a part of it under the MIT license terms. Instead, using two of them or two parts of them implies that you are using a subset of this collection. Thus a derived work of this collection which is licensed under the GPLv3 also.

The GPLv3 license applies to the composition unless you are the original copyright owner or the author of a specific unmodified file. This means that every one that can legally claim rights about the original files maintains its rights, obviously. So, it should not need to complain with the GPLv3 license applied to the composition. Unless, the composition is adopted for the part which had not the rights, before.

Some pages, documents, software or firmare components can make an exception to the above general approch due to their specific copyright and license restriction. In doubt follow the thumb rule of the fair use. Here a list of them: 

* Vendor's proprietary blobs for Sony Xperia 10 II (github repository)

Have fun! <3
